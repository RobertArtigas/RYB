## Development
IF you want me to continue improving these utilities, THEN send me an e-mail that you are using them.
 It might be useful to include your use case scenario and a description of why you want this improvement and how it helps the business you are involved in working.

# RYB (Run Your Business)
Run Your Business (RYB) template collection. Go to the [**WIKI**](https://github.com/RobertArtigas/RYB/wiki) 

These are a set of functional templates. Some that I use every day in a number of working projects.

They provide a number of practical developer aids for tracking multi-dll applications accross the complete system, apply globally consistent changes to inconsistent cosmetic standards being used over a period of time, to making sure that where you are can be identified to track possible errors. 

These are a collection of a lot of odd type items that have been built over a period of time and have made it into some commercial vendors utilities due to their usefullness over time being proven. There are better items than some of these utilities in comercial, free offerings, and out in the wild of the internet. There are some utilities that have made into the skype chats or newsgroups and have been added here. There are some same or similar requests that come up every now and then for some of these items. 

When the author can be identified, they are given credit. When no author can be identified, that fact is noted and hopefully someone will come and claim the utility. This is just a place to collect these utilities and functionality and make it available to all for their use and enjoyment. 

There a few items that are marked as "experimental" and are not completely worked out or tested in some environments. As much due diligence has been done as posible. As time progresses more testing should hopefully will be done. The SQL disconnect/reconnect templates came from different sources and work in some specific environments. Your milleage will vary. Be aware, and excercise extreme care. Do not use these SQL templates without extensive testing in a NON-PRODUCTION environment.
