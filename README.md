Run Your Business (RYB) template collection

These are a set of functional templates. Some that I use every day in a number of working projects.

They provide a number of practical developer aids for tracking multi-dll applications accross the complete system, apply globally consistent changes to inconsistent cosmetic standards being used over a period of time, to making sure that where you are can be identified to track possible errors. 

These are a collection of a lot of odd type items that have been built over a period of time and have made it into some of the some current vendors utilities due to their usefullness over time being proven. There are better items than some of these utilities in comercial, free offerings, and out in the wild of the internet. There are some utilities that have made into the skype chats or newsgroups and have been added here. There are some same or similar requests that come up every now and then for some of these items. 

When the author can be identified, they are given credit. When no author can be identified, that fact is noted and hopefully someone will come and claim the utility. This is just a place to collect these utilities and functionality and make it available to all for their use and enjoyment.
